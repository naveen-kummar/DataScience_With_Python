#importing the dataset

#importing dataset

#we want it as matrix so we will just specify lower and upper 
#bound as upper bound will not be included
X= dataset.iloc[:, 1:2].values

#splitting dataset into training and test set

#We are not going split into Training and Test data as we have small amount of data and we want to use 
#complete data for accurate prediction.

#Also we may not need Feature Scalling for most of the data set
